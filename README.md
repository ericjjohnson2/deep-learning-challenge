# deep-learning-challenge
Use deep learning to create a binary classifier that can predict application outcomes in this assignment for my data analytics bootcamp. Techniques include preprocessing the data, compiling, training, and evaluating the model, optimizing the model, and writing a report on the neural network model. This code will be written in Google Colab notebooks.
